[![IndyMill Final test](https://img.youtube.com/vi/s-xkdfNeIVw/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/s-xkdfNeIVw)

Simple automated solar powered watering system for your garden based on cool and inexpensive [Raspberry Pi Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-pico/). 
Designed by [Nikodem Bartnik](https://www.youtube.com/nikodembartnik). 

Most important features of this system

  - Simplicity
  - Watering based on time adjusted with buttons and current setting diplayed with LEDs
  - Ability to adjust watering cycles per day (1-4) and watering time (2,4,6,8 minutes per cycle) both values can be edjusted in the code
  - Single sided PCB that's easy to make at home
  - 2 water level sensors, 2 pumps and 2 soil moisture sensors to run two separete systems for different parts of the garden
  - Pumps controlled with IRFZ44N MOSFETs
  - Easy to 3D print case for the system
  - Beginner friendly

You will also need a PCB to solder all the components, [prefboard](https://amzn.to/3RsRubK) if you don't want to make a PCB or a [breadboard](https://amzn.to/3P7sjdo). PCB is designed to be machined on a CNC machine, the traces are a bit thicker than normal and it is single sided. You can also easily make it at home using different manufacturing techniques, of course ordering it from professional  manufacturers is also an option.

You can also checkout WDCS (Watering and Data Collection System) mentioned in the video. It's a more sophisticated solution with more sensor that you probably don't even need :) I suggest to stick to the Pico version because it is much better!
